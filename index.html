            Little short strokes. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.

            You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. And maybe a little bush lives there. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.
            
            I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.
            
            Every time you practice, you learn more. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Trees grow however makes them happy. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.
            
            These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Anyone can paint.
            
            You can do it. You gotta think like a tree. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. And just raise cain. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.
            
            This is a fantastic little painting. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can create anything that makes you happy. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.
